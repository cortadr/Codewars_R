********* PROBLEM **********

Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

It should look like this:

Sam Harris => S.H

patrick feeney => P.F

********** SOLUTION **********

def abbrev_name(name):
    res = ""
    for i in name.split(' '):
        res += i[0] + '.'
    return res[0:-1].title()
