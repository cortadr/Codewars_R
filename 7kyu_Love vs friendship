********* PROBLEM **********

Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

Then l + o + v + e = 54

and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

So friendship is twice as strong as love :-)

Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word based off the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters.

The input will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.

********* SOLUTION **********

words_to_marks <- function(s){
  alphabet <- letters
  char_pos <- setNames(1:26, alphabet)
  
  total_sum <- sum(char_pos[strsplit(s,"")[[1]]])
  return (total_sum)
}
